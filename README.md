# Tech Radar for the Scout24 Data Teams

Radar valid as of January 2019.

Inspired by the [ThoughtWorks Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar), the Data Technology teams at [Scout24](https://www.scout24.com/) (including Data Science, Data Engineering, Data Access and Machine Learning Engineering) created our own Tech Radar that documents the tools, techniques, frameworks, etc. that we use to build the Scout24 Data Platform and the company's machine learning solutions.

As this is the first time we created a Tech Radar, everything is marked as new and many default technologies (such as Amazon S3) were put on the radar. Next time, we will focus on the noteworthy choices that define how we work.

The raw data for the radar is available in this repository and you may view the radar using ThoughtWorks' interface here: <URL to come>
